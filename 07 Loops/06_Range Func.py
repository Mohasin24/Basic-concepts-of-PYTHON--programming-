# Range Func.:
'''The range function is used to generate sequence of no.
 We can also specify start, stop and step-size
Step-size is usually not used with range'''

#Syntax:
'''
for i in range (start, stop, step-size)
    print(i)
'''

for i in range (1, 10): #it will skip stop value and include start value
    print(i)
