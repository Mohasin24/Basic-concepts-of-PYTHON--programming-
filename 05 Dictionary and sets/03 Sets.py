# Sets : sets is a collection of non-repitative elements
#Use {} for defining a set
#E.g.:

a = {1,2,5,6,4} 
print(a)
print(type(a)) #It will not print the another 1

#sets are unordered, unindexed and non-repitative
#there is no way to change items in sets
#duplicate values are not allowed
thisset = {1,10,11,9}

print(thisset)

#Que :- why first output are in ordered
